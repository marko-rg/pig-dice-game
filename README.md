## Gameplay

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds

- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his current score.

- But, if the player rolls a 1, all his current score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.

- The player can choose to hold, which means that his current score gets added to his total score.
  After that, it's the next player's turn.

- The first player to reach 100 points on total score wins the game.
